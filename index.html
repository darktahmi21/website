    <p>
      I am pursuing Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering under <a href=https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/faculty_staff/faculty/jryckman.html target="_blank">Professor Dr. Judson D. Ryckman</a>.
      My primary research focuses on silicon and porous silicon <b>photonics</b>, <b>biosensing</b>, <b>nanofabrication</b> and <b>metasurfaces</b>.

  <!--  Prior to Clemson, I completed my BS in Electrical Engineering from
    <a href=http://www.sust.edu/ target="_blank">Shahjalal University of Science and Technology</a>, Bangladesh.
    </p>

    <p>
    I have a broad research interest which ranges from machine learning to nonlinear optics. I have always been amazed by the world, and
    this is why Physics draws me. I chose to work with material physics to have an impact on future integrated photonics which should soon replace
        other types of interconnects.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am a metal guitarist who is currently associated with the music project
    <a href=https://www.facebook.com/Radium-Is-Dying-811277302270196/
      target="_blank">Radium Is Dying</a> and in the past I released a song with
    <a href=https://www.facebook.com/NordicShadows/ target="_blank">Nordic Shadows</a>, where the ending solo is mine. I have also played in charity concerts with my university music group
        <a href=https://www.facebook.com/NONGAR.SUST/
      target="_blank">Nongar</a>, where fundraising a significant amount of money for the Savar victims was one of my accomplishments.
    </p>

      <p>
    I am also a semi-pro gamer who is currently a fill-in in the team
    <a href=https://www.facebook.com/InstinctEsportsBD/
      target="_blank">Instinct Esports</a> sponsored by

If you are a League player and you recognize me from this, give me a shoutout. I am also a streamer and youtuber. Check out my <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvb8iScCYQ_HKACzCN0V2Mg

    <h3>Projects</h3>


    <p>
    <pubtitle> Implementation of submarine robot for underwater navigation and communication
 </pubtitle>
    <br>
    A unconventional submarine robot was built using PVC, Water Pumps and Brushless DC Motors. The shape was unconventional, so it made way
    for electronics and batteries to be put in the middle. Communication was done via SONAR via Arduino. RF does not work underwater so it could not
    be used. See the preprint document <a href="pubs/kandasamyICML17boca.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <pubtitle> Small scale data transmission via light</pubtitle>
    <br>
    A commercially available low cost (1$ to be exact) light sensor was used to detect the light when transmitted via light. LED flashes, then home tubelights were used to
    vary the frequency to match the bit information. The found speeds were not remarkable, but has room for improvement if we do the implementation better. A better sensor
        will lead to a higher data rate. Read the paper <a href="pubs/kandasamyICML17boca.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>


     <p>
    <pubtitle> Remote home appliance control using DTMF Technology in cellphones </pubtitle>
    <br>
    We decided to ditch the conventional GSM technology and went for DTMF instead.  Read the paper <a href="pubs/kandasamyICML17boca.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <pubtitle> Remote controlled robot car (Pioneer) using Atmel AVR </pubtitle>
    <br>
    We built an RF controlled robot car in our first year using an AVR microcontroller and cheap mechanical parts.
    </p>

    <p>
    <pubtitle> Boolean equation generator from arbitrary logic input using Quine–McCluskey algorithm
(using C programming language) </pubtitle>
    <br>
    This was a second year project that I did alone. I wrote this program based on Quine-Mccluskey algorithm that can take logic tables as inputs and give boolean
        equations as outputs. Check the software section for the github link.
    </p>

    <p>
    <pubtitle> Construction of a 200VA power transformer</pubtitle>
    <br>
    It was a machine lab project. We practically wound laminated wires around an iron lump to make the transformer.
    </p>

    <p>
    <pubtitle>Designing a fire security system in a market floor on architectural drawing. </pubtitle>
    <br>
     This group project was done as a partial fulfilment of electrical service design lab.
    </p>

    <p>
    <pubtitle> Construction of a three-phase inductive load </pubtitle>
    <br>
    Was made using solenoids of known resistance and reactance. Wye and Delta both connection options were kept.
    </p>


    <p>
    <pubtitle> Designing of electrical service system of a student hall </pubtitle>
        <br>
        Done as a lone project for partial fulfilment of electrical service design lab.
